# Hello

<img align="left" style="width:200px; height:200px; border-radius:50%;" src="Images/Camilo_C.png" hspace="10">

My name is Camilo Castro. I am what most people might consider a jack of all trades. The reason for this is a tremendous enjoyment for technology as a whole. Throughout my life, I have had the curiosity of pretty much getting involved in a lot of learning adventures, all of them rewarding experiences that have shaped who I am and how I behave. My aspiration is to stop being a jack of all trades and focus on security, find a team that will allow me the opportunity to not only learn, but contribute, engage and why not, break things (I consider that is how we learn). 

I hope that small introduction entices your curiosity for more information; nonetheless, here is a small compilation of the many topics I have been interested and working on. I have always considered security to be the place for people such as myself who like and want to learn about everything.
